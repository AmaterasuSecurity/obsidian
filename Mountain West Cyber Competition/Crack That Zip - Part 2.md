We found a suspicious ZIP file on one of the systems. We think someone saved some files they downloaded from the internet. But we want to know for sure. Please crack this ZIP. Note: the password cannot be found in a dictionary or using brute-force, you have to use another technique.  
Flag format: CTF{32-hex} Hint 1: The original file was compressed using Winzip 9.0, you might need that same version. Hint 2: You don't need to know the password to decrypt a file, maybe just knowing the key is enough :)
