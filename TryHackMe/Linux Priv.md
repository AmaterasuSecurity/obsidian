How many programs can the user "karen" run on the target system with sudo rights?
I used sudo -l to find sudo rights under that account.
What is the content of the flag2.txt file?
We see that she can use the find command under sudo.
We then go to gtfobins.github.io to find info on the find command (pun not intended.) The first thing we find is how to get shell through sudo find. EXCELLENT.
How would you use Nmap to spawn a root shell if your user had sudo rights on nmap?
Again, if you look up nmap on gtfobins.github.io you will find your answer under the sudo section.
What is the hash of frank's password?
We can find this by catting /etc/shadow and grepping for frank.
